            <p>This is a tool for working out what proportion of visitors to a web page will be able to use all of its features.</p>
            <p>When you're considering using a new browser feature in a web app, you have to weigh up how many users will be excluded because their browser doesn't support it.</p>
            <p>The answer to this question doesn't just depend on how many browsers support the feature: it also depends on what other features you're already using.</p>
            <p>If a feature you're considering requires the same minimum versions as another feature you're using, there's no downside to using it.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Select all the features that your app already uses, either by clicking through the tree of features, or by searching for features by name.</p>

            <p>The browser support table will show you which browsers support all of the selected features, and from which versions.</p>
            <p>The status bar at the top of the page shows the percentage of all browsers, weighted by measured usage, that support the selected features.</p>
